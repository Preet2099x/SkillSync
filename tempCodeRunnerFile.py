Below are the job requirements and a candidate's resume text.

Job Requirements:
{job_requirements_str}

Resume:
{resume_text}

Evaluate the candidate's overall fitness for the role described above with a critical approach. Do not be overly generous. 
Consider the following points strictly:
- The candidate must meet the technical skills required (e.g., Docker, Node, AWS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- The candidate should have solid backend experience. A short duration of internships should be scored lower.
- Missing key backend skills should significantly lower the score.
- Prioritize depth and relevance of experience over breadth of skills that are not directly related to backend development.
- If critical skills or experience are lacking, the final score should reflect these deficiencies.
- Ensure that your final score is consistent with your detailed evaluation. Avoid significant fluctuations or inconsistent scoring between similar evaluations.

Provide a structured evaluation with detailed observations, and justify your score with specific reference to the job requirements. 
Format your response as:

**Strengths:**
- ...

**Weaknesses:**
- ...

**Final Score:** X/100
